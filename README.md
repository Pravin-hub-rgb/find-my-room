# üè† Find My Room

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth, Database, Storage)
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI
- **Maps**: React Leaflet + OpenStreetMap
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## üî• Core Features

  - Auto-fill state, district, and locality using reverse geocoding
  - Post fields: City, District, Locality, Title, Description, Price, Room Type (BHK), Images, Address (optional)


- **Room Listings & Search**:
  - Search/filter by city, district, price, and room type
  - Rooms displayed on map with pins using React Leaflet
  - Room cards show main image, title, location, and price

## üßπ Project Decisions
- **Clean and Modular Code**: Components and logic are organized neatly for maintainability `lib/` folder is used for helper functions (instead of `utils/`)
- **Room Form** is shared between create and edit flows for a consistent user experience
- **Frontend Calculations**: Ratings and other calculated data are done on the client side
- **Supabase Storage** handles all image uploads, deletions, and replacements
- **City & District Filtering** for efficient room browsing

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
